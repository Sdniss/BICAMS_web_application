Conversion tables to convert raw to scaled scores
-------------------------------------------------

Every conversion table accords with one of the 3 cognitive tests from BICAMS (SDMT, BVMT-R and CVLT-II).
It consists of the following columns:
- scaled_score: Categorical variable, the scaled score that accords with a raw score within the following interval lower and upper bound.
- lower bound: lower bound of the raw score to yield a certain scaled score
- upper bound: upper bound of the raw score to yield a certain scaled score

Thus: scaled_score accords with lower_bound <= raw_score <= upper_bound
Note: Also 'equal to' belongs to the interval between the lower and upper bounds!
